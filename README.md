# MalAware
App for Software Engineering

##How download and use the project files
Download the repo and open/run it using [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools)

##How to play the game
Tap the image in the center to generate a resource.
Once you have 10 resources, swipe from the right side of the screen to the left and click "No generators available".
Yeah, I know that doesn't make sense but just do it.
From the popup window hit the "x1" option.

You are now automatically generating resources

Once you have 10 resources again, swipe from the left side of the screen to the right and click "Autotap" from the menu
Now, you can click the button and watch a countdown which doesn't do anything...yet
